  ### Week 11:
  Hello there and welcome to the end of week 12,
 
For this week's assignment, we had to:
1. Send data to a computer and write code to display results (e.g., visualization of sensor data, browser-based game with microcontroller-based interactions, etc.)


I went ahead and first wanted to practice something that we had learned in class. <a href='./p5.html'>Processing and p5</a><br>
with this new knowledge and he help of this guy: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHm5sxfqw5Oq2mbiYH1kgzw/videos'>Coding with Mr Ward</a>, I made a shooting game using p5.

Things I learned: Mainly how to make an interactive game that responds to keyboard commands which was so cool
<ul>
<li>How to create figures (for a circle, it’s literally a function called circle)</li>
<li>Make the figure responsive to the mouse by instead of fixing it’s y or x position, literally write mouseX or mouseY as its input</li>
<li>How to make the figure respond to a mouse click</li>
<li>Fascinating that we can also instead of fixing a position, we can ask the program to randomize it by just using the function “random” as simple as that</li>
</ul>

Future improvements:
with the bullets and the whole game in general:
 
<ul><li>make fancy colors</li>
    <li>diff sizes and shapes,</li>
    <li>Health (if you miss 3 bullets that’s when you die or you lose 1 life out of idk how many each time you miss a bullet</li>
    <li>Can it play a sound every time something idk happens?</li>
    <li>Limit bullet number?</li>
    <li>Increase the speed every time</li>
    <li>Increase enemy number</li>
    <li>Different types of enemies</li>
    <li>Some of them have armor and special effects (like drifting instead of going straight)</li>
    <li>High score board </li>
    <li>Make the circle move by itself and Use a button to shoot the bullets</li>
 
</ul>
</p>
 
Here is the code I used:
 
 
  <pre>
    <code>
let bullets = [];
let enemies = [];
let score = 0;
 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
 
  // spawn enemies
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    //making an enemy 10 times
    let enemy = {
      x: random(0, width),
      y: random(-800, 0),
    };
    //as soon as you make an enemy add it to the array list
    enemies.push(enemy);
  }
}
 
function draw() {
  background(51);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  //draw the player
  circle(mouseX, height - 50, 25);
 
  //update and draw bullets
  for (let bullet of bullets) {
    bullet.y -= 10;
    circle(bullet.x, bullet.y, 10);
  }
 
  //update and draw enemies
  for (let enemy of enemies) {
    enemy.y += 2;
    //this number above will determine how fast they will ie how hard the game will be
    rect(enemy.x, enemy.y, 10);
    if (enemy.y > height) {
      text("You Lose!", width / 2, height / 2);
      noLoop();
    }
  }
 
  // deal with collisions
  for (let enemy of enemies) {
    for (let bullet of bullets) {
      //how can I improve this next line?
      if (dist(enemy.x, enemy.y, bullet.x, bullet.y) < 10) {
        //get rid of the enemy wherever the enemy is
        enemies.splice(enemies.indexOf(enemy), 1);
        bullets.splice(bullets.indexOf(bullet), 1);
        let newEnemy = {
          x: random(0, width),
          y: random(-800, 0),
        };
        //as soon as you make an enemy add it to the array list
        enemies.push(newEnemy);
        score += 1;
      }
    }
  }
 
  text(score, 15, 25);
}
 
function mousePressed() {
  // spawn a bullet when the use clicks
  //console.log ('Im clicked')
  let bullet = {
    x: mouseX,
    y: height - 50,
  };
  bullets.push(bullet);
}
 
    </code>

   And here is the game in action
