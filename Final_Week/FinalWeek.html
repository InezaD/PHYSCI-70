  ### Final Week
  We made it this far. Congratulations to us!
  
  After several hours, days, weeks (and some tears), we finally finished our final project. 
  Just as a reminder. The idea was to help my friends Lerato, Jordan and Djibril and their hydroponics farm because they had the issue that they couldn't tell when the temperature had dropped below a certain level. 

  For this project, I used a total of three inputs:
  <ul>
  <li>a button and a temperature sensor</li>
  <li>a temperature sensor</li>
  <li>a LOT of hope and patience</li>
</ul>
  I also use a total of four outputs
<ul>
  <li>a blue and red LED to signal the ideal and non-ideal state of the temperature respectively</li>
  <li>a buzzer in form of a piezzo </li>
  <li>a servo motor</li>
  <li>JOY when it finally worked</li>
</ul>

I also used an esp32 Huzzah Feather as well as a breadboard to connect everything.

  Just a small heads up, I will be talking about temperature rising above a certain value because for the sake of this project's demonstration, it was easier to increase the sensor value by touching it and seeing a reaction than decreasing it. 

  Before we dive into the details of how everything was connected, here is a workthrough of how the project was supposed to work

  <li>the temperature sensor reads a value</li>
  <li>a line of code converts that value first into voltage and then into a temperature</li>
  <li>if the temperature is below 13 (which was what I had considered the ideal temperature to be), then a blue led would light up</li>
  pro tip here: first read the baseline temperature and adjust your if statement accordingly. Mine kept changing depending on which room I was running the program from and changed from 25 to 13 degrees celsius.

  <li>if the temperature reads a value above 13, turn on the red LED, ring the alarm and wait for the button to be pressed to indicate that the person has been notified and also turn off the alarm, send a notification on their phone and also turn on the motor ( I am imagining that the motor can serve to proceed to cool up the pond to a desired temperature)
  </li>
  <li> After the button is pressed, hit the reset button to reset the program so it can take it new values</li>

</ul>

Now that we have the workflow down. I can reveal to you the magic arduino code that makes it work. 

However, a small confession. I was not able to make both the button to turn the alarm off and send the notification to the phone. I was able to do both task, but separately. I will show you the code for both and hopefully you will be able to incorporate both into one program (and then please let me know).

First: the code with the button pressed to send the notification on the phone as well as activating the Red LED, the piezo and the motor:

  const int BUTTON_PIN = A4;
  
  //declarations from metro program
  int Ena = 7;
  volatile byte state = LOW;
  int buzzerPin = 4; // Positive buzzer pin connected to pin 5
  long max_frequency = 2500; // Max frequency for the buzzer
  long frequency; // The frequency to buzz the buzzer

  Then the code to turn off the alarm once pressed:

   //use this code.from toggling led

   const int BUTTON_PIN = A4; // Arduino pin connected to button's pin
   const int LED_PIN    = 12; // Arduino pin connected to LED's pin
   
   int channel = 0;
   int resolution = 8;
   // variables will change:
   int buzzerState = LOW;     // the current state of LED

   void setup() {

       ledcWriteTone(channel, frequency);
     }
   }
    </code>
  </pre>

  Now here is a video showing how I connected everything (note: the button represented here was used to send the notification on the phone, not to turn off the alarm):
  <video width="620" height="440" controls src="IMG_7857.mp4"></video>

  And a picture of the circuitry for when the button was being used to stop the alarm:
  <div class="column">
    <img src="IMG_7868.jpeg" alt="Side view" style="width:100%">
  </div>

  In order to send the message notification on my phone, I followed the tutorial found here: <a href="https://www.techtonions.com/signal-esp32-send-message-and-image/">Home</a> 
  Here is a screenshot of the message notifications I received:
  <div class="column">
    <img src="IMG_7857.jpeg" alt="Side view" style="width:100%">
  </div>

  Now here is what we all waited for. A video demonstrating the final project in action:
  <video width="620" height="440" controls src="final_62800703e6426d00d67e17f4_640539.mp4"></video>
  You can also access it using this <a href="/05_Week_5/Week5.html">link</a>
  
  Major challenges:
  1. Making the button work. 
  2. At first I had used a metro arduino uno and couldn't make it communicate with the esp32 until I switched every pin onto the esp32 

  Future improvements:
  1. Make the button do the two tasks o
  <h3>CREDITS</h3>
   I honestly would not have done it without the tremendous help and patience of the TFs and classmates. But a very special shoutout to Nathan and Kassia!
