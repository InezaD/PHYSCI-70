  ### Week 9: Networking (IoT): WiFi and Bluetooth

  Hello there and welcome to the end of week 10,


  For this week's assignment, we had to:

  1. Demonstrate communication between a microcontroller and another device.
  2. Optionally, work with a partner to control a device remotely.


  My parter Lauren and I had the idea of making a sentimental but pratical piece. The goal was to make interactive
  picture frames that could communicate from a distance using wifi or bluetooth once one was touched.

  Inspiration: We were thinking about ways to nurture long distance relationships with family, friends and partners by
  letting them know you are thinking about them which eventually would encourage you to contact them and stay
  connected.

  What it does: There are two sister picture frames in two different locations and once you touch one frame, the other
  picture will instantaneously light up and your loved ones will know that you are thinking about them. This works in
  the other way as well.

  How we intended to build it: We were going to place one Arduino in each etched frame, and configured the ESP32
  Huzzah Feather for each Arduino between two frames, such that they can communicate wirelessly. This can easily be
  replaced with Wifi communication, so that frames can be placed longer distances apart. We were going to use copper
  plates and attach them on the frames too so they can act as capacitors in a RC circuit, and once a person touches
  the frame, their capacitance adds in parallel and increases the overall capacitance. Therefore, the RC time constant
  of the circuit changes thus enabling us to detect changes in frequency of a wave. It works such that the mother
  Arduino sends data to a child Arduino and vice versa. The Arduino is therefore capable of sending and receiving
  signals, so when one frame is touched, its "sister" frame is lit up.

  Accomplishments that we're proud of: Capacitive touch sensing, connect the sensor so firebase can detect when it's
  being used

  Challenges we ran into: Bluetooth communication between the Arduinos

  So to some extent we executed this week's assignment which was to remotely and wirelessly turn an output device (LED
  in our case) on and off using firebase except that it one not considering the device since we couldn't manage to
  make them communicate.
  I just wish we were able to figure out how to let the other arduino know that it the sister frame has been touched
  so it can also light its own LED
  The arduino codes we used:
  For the mother arduino:
