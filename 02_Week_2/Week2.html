  ### Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting
  Hello there, 

  For this second week, we were asked to create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for lasercutter kerf.
  I decided to work on a flower inspired by a rose whose sketch can be found at the bottom of the page. Here below is the final result.

  For the realization of this press-fit construction. I played around fusion 360 and created different shapes to recreate the design of petals and the flower stem that's support them. 
  
  Here are screenshots of the initial sketches I made of the flower stem and petals in fusion 360 and their dimensions.

  The major setback was realizing which thickness to give the kerf because I first cut with a dimension that was too big and my pieces could not stay together. The fun part was creating different shapes of the petals and getting creative with it. The assembly of the pieces turn out to be more tedious than I anticipated, but I liked the final result.
