  ### About Me

  Hello there, 

  My name is Daniella Ineza, and I come from a tiny but beautiful country called Burundi (check pictures of each week's page's thumbnail for proof). I am now a Senior at Harvard University studying Mechanical Engineering with a Secondary in Educational Studies. My field of interest is in Humanitarian and International Development though (If you are wondering then why I am doing ME, well you and me both!). I enjoy the practicality of ME though and the kind of impact it has on society and want to explore how to use it for the development of underpriviledged communities. I am now taking Phy 70 to build more technical skills and have fun working on a final project. 

  Now, here is an image of me when I still had short hair:

  And here is a	[link] to my final project description (../finalproject.html).
